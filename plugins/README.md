## Contribute Liferea Plugins!

Plugins are usually in Python3 and it is easier than ever to change
core behaviours of Liferea using plugins!

To get an idea how simple it is to modify or extend Liferea with 
a plugin have a look at "bold-unread.py" which grabs a handle to
the feed list and changes the visual rendering of feed titles.

## Adding 3rd Party Plugins

Using the "plugin installer" Liferea allows installing plugins
from a curated list of 3rd party (Github) sources. This list is
the "plugin-list.json" file you find in this directory.
